# InsireBot-V2
This is a rewrite of the original InsireBot.

Things are very in flux at the moment. So downloading the repo might give you a working player or just a bunch of code.
If you wanna try this ahead of time, message me and i can try to give you a working sample. No promises though.

Requirements:
 - Visual Studio 2015 (.NET 4.6.1)
 - VLC installed in the default directory
 - Windows 7++

## planned features
- playback of local audio files and youtube videos, possibly other web sources aswell
- syncing your playlist with your youtube account
- deciding on which audio device you playback your music
- some form of chat integration (discord?, irc?, twitch?)
