[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2bgiexw53ktd5lhp?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Insire/insirebot-v2)

This is a rewrite of the original InsireBot. Which was planned to be a tool for semi and non professional livestreamers to provide music to them selfs and to their audience with high configureability.

After a long hiatus, I'm continuing my rewrite and try to improve on my previously written code.
